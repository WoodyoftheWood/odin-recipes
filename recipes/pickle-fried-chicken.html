        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Use brine left over from your favorite pickles to add flavor and keep your fried chicken moist.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>4 (5 ounce) chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 cups dill pickle juice</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Â¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag; cover with pickle juice. Seal and refrigerate for 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Drain pickle juice from thighs. Cover chicken; refrigerate until ready to fry or up to 1 day.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Pour buttermilk into a bowl. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in another bowl. Dredge chicken in buttermilk, then toss in flour. Return to buttermilk and toss in flour a second time. Place chicken on the wire rack.</li>
            <li>Fill Dutch oven with as many thighs as possible without crowding. Cook in the preheated oil until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer thighs to a nonstick baking sheet and repeat until all pieces are fried.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
